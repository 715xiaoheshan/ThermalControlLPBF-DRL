# ThermalControlLPBF


This repository is the implementation of the paper "Thermal Control of Laser Powder Bed Fusion Using Deep Reinforcement Learning". It leverages stable-baselines3 and PyTorch to derive a control policy that maximizes melt pool depth consistency as determined by Eagar-Tsai simulation of the melting process.
